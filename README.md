Epilepsy Detection. Seizure, non-Seizure. Using VGG-16 Architecture and Transfer Learning in an Opensource Dataset

Please read this carefully:
1. The data has been processed before (converted from signals to images) so we just used plotted data in able to use 2D CNNs.
2. In this code, the VGG-16 architecture has been commented. The results in a notebook are for a simple architecture to just see if the data and pre-processed data works and probable poor results are not because of data.
3. The VGG-16 architecture has been implemented in 2 ways. 1-using the Keras functions and 2- building each layer one by one.
This code is just like a tutorial and for Fun, at least for me.

Enjoy :))
